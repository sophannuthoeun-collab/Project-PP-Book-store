    description:
      "The book uses vivid storytelling to explain complex phenomena, such as how European Robins use quantum entanglement in their eyes to 'see' the Earth's magnetic field during migration, or how plants use quantum superposition to achieve nearly 100% efficiency in photosynthesis. It even touches on the role of quantum tunneling in DNA mutations and enzymes. It is a groundbreaking look at how the most fundamental laws of physics might be the very thing that differentiates 'life' from 'dead matter.'",

      "The authors trace the Neanderthal lineage back nearly a million years, showing that they were actually highly successful, resilient survivors who navigated ice ages, created art, buried their dead, and likely had a form of language. Most importantly, it covers the 'interbreeding' discovery—proving that most modern humans still carry Neanderthal DNA today. It’s a fast-paced narrative that moves from the first fossil discoveries in the 19th century to the cutting-edge genomic breakthroughs of the 21st.",

Sheldrake argues that fungi challenge our very definition of 'individuality,'' as they exist in a constant state of relationship and flow. It’s a beautifully written blend of rigorous science and philosophical wonder that will change how you look at the ground beneath your feet.",

It is widely considered one of the most influential books in the history of cognitive science and artificial intelligence.",
